        <span class="date">Posted 11:38 EDT on July 11, 2014</span>


        <p><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8jyu08b7P1ri3xd7.jpg?1473544868463"/></p>

<p>Last year, Center for Rights and Fight for the Future helped thousands take action to call for the release of Barrett Brown, a citizen journalist and transparency activist whose trumped up charges set a chilling precedent for freedom of speech.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a link to our petition: <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/barrett-brown/" target="_blank">http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/barrett-brown/</a></strong></p>
<p>Please see below a statement directly from <a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/" target="_blank">FreeBarrettBrown.org</a></p>
<p><strong>&lt;3 Fight for the Future</strong></p>
<p>Today we have a tremendous support statement from <strong><a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/supporters/#pussyriot" target="_blank">Masha Alekhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova</a></strong>, the Russian dissidents known as Pussy Riot. Here&rsquo;s what they had to say about Barrett:</p>
<blockquote>“In Russia, where we live, the rights of journalists carry very little weight and people who aspire for a free press have much envy for the conditions in which media in the West usually functions. But cases that attack whistleblowers, journalists and activists allow Russian propaganda to point to foreign countries and say that “freedom of press” there similarly comes with the prosecution of journalists. Barrett’s case is one that should not be happening in a Western democracy and we hope that American authorities will not continue to set such a horrible example by giving Barrett any more time behind bars.&ldquo;</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong><a href="http://voiceproject.org/" target="_blank">The Voice Project</a></strong> and its executive director <strong><a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/supporters/#hunter" target="_blank">Hunter Heaney</a></strong> have signed on to the campaign to free Barrett Brown.<br/><br/> Without having heard from him, we suspect that Barrett is still being held in segregation since a June 17 &quot;semi-disturbance&rdquo; at Seagoville, which <strong><a href="http://frontburner.dmagazine.com/2014/07/01/the-barrett-brown-review-of-arts-and-letters-and-jail-a-visit-to-the-hole/" target="_blank">he wrote about in his last column</a></strong>. Many members of the public have been <strong><a href="http://www.bop.gov/inmates/concerns.jsp" target="_blank">expressing their concerns</a></strong> to the Bureau of Prisons. There&rsquo;s no word yet on when he will be released back to the regular population. Since he didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong and his behavioral record has been otherwise spotless, it&rsquo;s doubtful that he will be charged with an infraction following any disciplinary hearing. It&rsquo;s so hot in the hole that inmates strip to their underwear during the day — this is why the Texas Civil Rights Project is <strong><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/20/justice/texas-prison-heat-lawsuit/" target="_blank">suing over the lack of air-conditioning</a></strong> in Texas state prisons.<br/><br/> If you&rsquo;re attending the HOPE X (Hackers on Planet Earth) conference in NYC <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457146"><span class="aQJ">July 18-20</span></span>, there will be two panels related to Barrett Brown. <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457147"><span class="aQJ">On Friday at noon</span></span>, Brown&rsquo;s attorney Ahmed Ghappour, Anonymous expert Gabriella Coleman, and FreeBB director Kevin Gallagher <strong><a href="http://hope.net/schedule.html#barrettbro" target="_blank">will discuss his case and other matters</a></strong>. Then <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457148"><span class="aQJ">on Saturday at 4PM</span></span>, a group of journalists and researchers will gather to talk about the importance of <strong><a href="http://hope.net/schedule.html#projectpmc" target="_blank">Project PM and crowd-sourced research</a> </strong>of the cyber-intelligence complex, which was founded and pioneered by Barrett.<br/><br/> We hope to see you there, and at Barrett&rsquo;s sentencing, which will occur <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_975457149"><span class="aQJ">October 6th, 2014 at 1:30 PM CST</span></span> at the federal courthouse on 1100 Commerce St. in Dallas, TX.<br/><br/> If you&rsquo;re wondering what Barrett is still charged with and what he&rsquo;s facing, there&rsquo;s a <strong><a href="http://wiki.project-pm.org/wiki/Barrett_Brown#Current_Case_Disposition_Post_Plea_Agreement" target="_blank">wiki page with a detailed case timeline and the current case disposition</a></strong> (all with references to source documents, as well as an accurate biography and links to important writings). As always, media and press inquiries are welcome.<br/><br/> Thank you for supporting us.<span class="HOEnZb"><br/>Free Barrett Brown<br/></span></p>

        <p><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8elocvSs11qb05d0.png?1473544868464"/></span></p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>Urgent action needed: Congress is trying to bring back CISPA &hellip; again.</span></a></p>

<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>

<p><span>Over the weekend a detailed report in the Washington Post caught the U.S. government in more lies about the scope of its dragnet surveillance programs. The Post showed that the NSA intercepted communications from ordinary people 9 times more often than from “targets” suspected of any wrongdoing.</span></p>

<p><span>People are outraged. And we should be. Any politician that plans to keep their job should be doing everything they can to put an end to these illegal and unethical surveillance practices.</span></p>

<p><span>Infuriatingly, *today* the Senate Intelligence Committee is rushing to advance “CISA,” a bill that would give the NSA </span><span>more</span><span> access to our data than ever before, </span><span>and</span><span> give companies like Facebook and Google legal immunity for violating our privacy.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>Your signature is needed to stop CISA, the new CISPA. Will you click here to take action right now? Every second counts, the markup is this afternoon.</span></a></p>

<p><span>Does “CISA” sound kind of familiar? That’s because it’s another zombified version of CISPA, a bill that Internet users have beaten back twice before.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s despicable that the Senate Intelligence Committee, who are supposed to oversee the government’s spying programs and protect our rights, is choosing this moment to resurrect CISPA, and sneaking it through in a closed door markup.</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks to the huge rise in privacy activism and reporting over the past year, it should be easier than ever to defeat legislation like this. But we have to remain vigilant. Congress is trying to do this quietly; we can’t let them. </span><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>Take action right now.</span></a></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:12 EDT on July 1, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://standagainstspying.org/?r=fftf" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n81ry7l8nQ1ri3xd7.png?1473544868464"/></span></a></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-4e68daa7-f355-17c8-af47-273eed625ff2"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>After our last email about how all of you helped &ndash; against great odds &ndash; get critical Amendments passed that limit U.S. government surveillance, many of you wrote to us with one question: </span><em>how did my lawmakers vote?</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://standagainstspying.org/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Report cards are in! Click here to find out how your reps measured up. Did they get an “A” for working to protect our rights? Or an “F” for failing to do their jobs?</a></strong></p>
<p><span>With our friends at EFF and a dozen other organizations, we’ve created a handy scorecard that grades members of U.S. Congress based on what they’ve been doing (or often haven’t been doing) to protect our privacy in the face of out of control government monitoring. </span></p>
<p><strong>Now we know who to blame for the mess that we’re in, and who’s been taking steps to get us out of it.</strong></p>
<p><span>The campaign is called “Stand Against Spying” and it’s gaining support from the left, right and center. We’ve made it easy for U.S. citizens to find out how their representatives voted and contact them to express their opinions.  But this affects everyone, not just those in the U.S., so there’s also a simple tool allowing anyone to sign on to an open letter to the Whitehouse.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://standagainstspying.org/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Click here to take your stand against spying. </a></strong></p>
<p><span>It seems like every day we learn more about the dirty secrets our governments have been keeping about how they spy on us. We need to fight with every tool in the toolbox. We’ll continue to work daily to secure the web through technology, and we’ll hold our leaders to account by demanding they do everything in their power to end the bulk collection of our private phone and internet data.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://standagainstspying.org/?r=fftf" target="_blank">Don’t let Congress get away with ignoring our rights. Click here to find out how lawmakers have been voting, and then do something about it.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Stay tuned for exciting announcements about Reset the Net later this month.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Evan, and Kevin<br/>Fight for the Future</span><br/><br/><strong>P.S. If you can, <a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">please chip in $5 (or whatever you’ve got!)</a> to support our ongoing work to keep the Internet awesome?</strong></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-06-25-net-neutrality-protesters-arrested-late-last-night/">Net neutrality protesters arrested late last night at Google headquarters. Fight for the Future supports actions for net freedom, asks Google to dialogue with activists.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:04 EDT on June 25, 2014</span>


        <p><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7qqfur3pM1ri3xd7.jpg?1473544868464"/></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-3fb3b003-d48c-c983-6bc0-cf7f4ef75ae5"><span>On Tuesday, June 24th, a group of activists set up tents and banners in front of Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, CA, announcing their protest online at </span><strong><a href="http://occupygoogle.org" target="_blank">http://OccupyGoogle.org</a></strong><span> and tweeting from </span><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/occupygoogl" target="_blank">@OccupyGoogl</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Late last night, 10 activists, including a journalist who was livestreaming the event, were arrested for trespassing. We at Fight for the Future congratulate these people who are speaking out at this important time. <strong>It gives us hope for the future of the web to see young Internet freedom activists so passionate about this issue</strong> &ndash; and we hope that Google will sit down and talk with them and listen to what they have to say, rather than resort to involving law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you agree, feel free to call the Google press office and leave a message here: 1-650-930-3555.</strong></p>
<p><span>We suggest you be polite, and ask them to meet with the Occupy Google demonstrators and listen to their demands, and not unnecessarily involve the authorities allowing for more arrests.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7qqb6X6lO1ri3xd7.png?1473544868464"/></span></p>
<p><strong>Here’s the background:</strong></p>
<p><span>We didn’t know about this protest ahead of time, but we smiled when we heard the news. We love the transformative power of the free and open Internet and we’ve dedicated the past several years of our lives to building movement to protect it. We think it’s awesome to see that movement growing, and to see passionate people taking action to defend the Internet they love, and help build the Internet they want to see.</span></p>
<p><span>The protester’s demands were pretty simple, really: they were asking Google to engage in a conversation about what Google should be doing to fight for Net Neutrality.</span><span> The activists felt like Google could be doing a lot more, and started the camp-out to apply pressure.</span></p>
<p><span>The context here is that Google has expressed support for Net Neutrality in letters some lobbying, but haven’t yet thrown down on the issue the way they could.</span></p>
<p><strong>It’s an interesting tactic. Here’s how Occupy Google explains their reasoning:<br/></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Though Google and other major companies such as Netflix, Amazon and Microsoft have come out in support of preserving a free and open web, </span><span>we believe much more can be done. </span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span> </span><span>    </span></p>
<p><span>Though many of us have concerns about the larger implications of Google&rsquo;s effect on the world, as far as surveillance and ties to military technology, </span><strong>we are not here to protest Google. <br/></strong><span><br/></span><strong>Google, with its immense power, has a social responsibility to uphold the values of the internet.</strong><span> We encourage Google to engage in a serious, honest dialogue on the issue of net neutrality and to stand with us in support of an internet that is free from censorship, discrimination, and access fees. </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>They went on to explain that they wanted Google to engage in a dialogue with them about how the company could do more to help win net neutrality at this critical moment that will have lasting ramifications for what the Internet of the future will be. They proposed some actions, including Google blacking out their site and pointing to a petition during an online action July 10th. </span><span>But they also left it open ended, offering that Google could </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Create their own creative way to connect their users to this issue and how to fight back.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Adding:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>We are committed to occupying the Google Headquarters until the company gets involved in honest dialogue on net neutrality, and until real action is taken to maintain a free and open internet.</span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span><span>    </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>So when it comes down to it, all these folks were asking for was to chat.</span><span> They wanted someone from Google to come out and talk with them about what the company was doing, what it was going to do, and would it do more to defend something they really held dear: the uncensored web.</span></p>
<p><span>Google is a company that professes to care deeply about transparency, openness, and the future of the open Internet. T<strong>he passionate people who set up tents on their lawn were expressing similar goals. </strong></span><strong>It sounds to us like Google leadership probably would have had a great time if they’d brought some lemonade and sandwiches down to the camp and had a chat with these folks, rather than allowing them to be forcibly arrested en masse and charged with trespassing.</strong></p>
<p><span>What harm would it have done for Google to talk with these activists? There are very real types of harm that could come from having them arrested, both to the activists (who could face fines, probation, immigration, and other issues) and to Google, who has now lost a bit more trust from the Internet freedom movement as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span>The Occupy Google activists have </span><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/occupygoogl/statuses/481790399795585024" target="_blank">called for a demonstration today</a></strong><span> outside the Google I/O conference, at Moscone Center 747 Howard St. 12 noon PST. If there are any journalists in the area, we suggest they get down there, but don’t forget to have your lawyer’s number handy&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span>We at Fight for the Future support all forms of creative protest to draw attention to the urgent need for action around net neutrality, and we hope that Google will engage in meaningful conversation with these protesters, and refrain from unnecessarily involving the police or authorities. “Don’t be evil,” Google. Talk it out with these folks and jump in the fight.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finally, though Occupy Google protesters haven’t mentioned this, we’d love to see Google come out strongly in support of the only real path toward lasting net neutrality: reclassifying the Internet as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act.</strong><span> Google has expressed its opposition to Tom Wheeler’s proposal, but hasn&rsquo;t yet echoed the demands of nearly every free speech, Internet policy, or human rights advocacy group in the country that is calling for reclassification. That would be one very clear and meaningful way that Google could show these demonstrators that they are truly committed to net neutrality and keeping the Internet free.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n7qqedFqXB1ri3xd7.jpg?1473544868464"/></span></p>
