      <h1><a href="/news/2016-05-17-a-look-inside-the-closed-door-dmca-meetings/">A look inside the closed-door DMCA meetings</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:49 EDT on May 17, 2016</span>


        <a href="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org/takedownabuse.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org/takedownabuse_cropped.jpg" alt="Jeff and Andrew Lyon outside SF courthouse"/></a>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I’m Jeff, CTO at Fight for the Future.  We recently teamed up with <a href="http://channelawesome.com" target="_blank">Channel Awesome</a> to launch <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a>, a web protest to fight the ongoing mass censorship of the Internet due to abusive copyright takedowns under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who helped overwhelm the government with nearly 100,000 public comments, we were able to convince the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) to give us a seat at the table in their closed-door meetings on DMCA reforms. Mike from Channel Awesome and I traveled to San Francisco, eager to speak on behalf of everyone who took action at <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the hearings appeared to be rigged against the public interest, and unless we step up our game, it’s looking very likely that the USCO will make the DMCA even worse, with major giveaways to the copyright industry that put SOPA-style restrictions on independent content creators.</p>

<p>Here are some of my experiences and thoughts about what we’re up against:</p>

<ul><li><p>The “roundtable discussions” were closed-door meetings with limited seating that effectively shut the public out from the proceedings. No live streaming was available and very limited open microphone time made it nearly impossible for anyone who wasn’t an invited participant to speak.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of participants, the hearings were dominated by representatives and lobbyists from the copyright industry. Representatives from other public interest groups like Mozilla and EFF were completely outnumbered by organizations like the RIAA, MPAA, Digimarc and Copyright Alliance. You can <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/policy/section512/ca-agenda.pdf" target="_blank">see the participant list here</a>, but the end result was the lobbyists were able to skew the discussions in their favor.</p></li>
<li><p>The copyright industry wants to eliminate the counter-notice process that people can use to fight DMCA takedown claims. Instead they want a “take down, stay down” system where website owners have to police user-uploaded content and proactively remove any copyrighted material. I argued that this would create an enormous burden for website owners and make it effectively impossible for users to upload copyrighted works in fair-use contexts (such as parody or political commentary).</p></li>
<li><p>The only time I saw the stone-faced regulators break from their serious demeanor was when it was the MPAA attorney’s turn to talk. After some some light-hearted joking banter with the regulators, the MPAA attorney suggested new legislation to take down entire websites (aka SOPA) for suspected copyright infringement.</p></li>
<li><p>There were repeated attempts by the copyright industry to discredit the nearly 100,000 public comments sent through <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">takedownabuse.org</a>. I sat next to the CEO of Copyright Alliance, who had previously likened us to “<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-group-likens-massive-dmca-abuse-protests-to-zombie-apocalypse-160409/" target="_blank">zombies.</a>” One of the other participants accused us of engaging in a cyber attack. Both Mike from Channel Awesome and I argued passionately on behalf of everyone who submitted comments, that the Copyright Office needs to take the public input seriously. We are not robots or zombies or hackers! We are real people who are living with an Internet where fair use and free speech is under attack.</p></li>
</ul><p>And here’s where the good news starts. The MPAA and RIAA wanted to go into these meetings and have a one-sided discussion where they could spread doom-and-gloom about how the Internet is destroying their business models. We made this impossible. They never expected to be facing down 100,000 public comments and the same people who helped kill SOPA. We called the industry to task for their abuse of the DMCA and we’re ready for anything they might throw at us next.</p>

<p>Speaking of that, the U.S. Copyright Office will open up another round of public commenting in the coming weeks. We don’t yet know whether they’ll take our concerns seriously, but we will have a lot more than 24 hours to get our comments in, regardless. Please stay tuned by signing up at <a href="https://www.takedownabuse.org" target="_blank">www.takedownabuse.org</a> and we’ll be sure to tell you when the next round of comments opens!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jeff Lyon<br/>
CTO, Fight for the Future</p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-04-13-internet-activists-stand-in-solidarity-with/">Internet activists stand in solidarity with striking Verizon workers</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:27 EDT on April 13, 2016</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>April 13, 2016<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><i>Leading net neutrality advocates Fight for the Future say Verizon’s greed is bad for workers as well as the Internet</i></h2><p>Today, more than 40,000 Verizon workers went on <b><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/276119-verizon-workers-go-on-strike" target="_blank">strike</a>,</b> demanding fair treatment from the telecom giant that grossed more than $4 billion in profit last year. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><b>Fight for the Future</b></a>, a leading digital rights group best known for organizing some of the largest online protests in history, including the massive online protests against SOPA and in support of net neutrality, issued the following statement in support of Verizon workers, which can be attributed to campaign director, Evan Greer:</p><blockquote><p><i>“Given everything we know about how terribly Verizon treats their customers and Internet users as a whole, it’s no surprise to us that they fail to show their employees basic respect as well.</i></p><p><i>Last year, they attempted to strike down net neutrality rules that protect the Internet as a platform for freedom of expression and exchange of ideas. The Internet rose up and we defeated them, gaining even stronger protections than the ones they sued to strike down.</i></p><p><i>Rather than treating their customers and employees fairly, Verizon has chosen to rely on political influence and corruption in a never ending quest to increase short term profits regardless of the long term cost to society.</i></p><p><i>We at Fight for the Future stand in solidarity with the striking Verizon workers, and with all Internet users who are fighting to defend the Internet from the attacks of monopolistic ISPs like Verizon.”</i></p><p><i>Verizon’s customers fought for net neutrality, and won. Verizon’s workers deserve to win fair treatment too, and we wish them success in their struggle.”</i></p></blockquote><p>Please note: Greer’s correct pronouns are she/hers.</p><p>Fight for the Future was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year. They built the page <b><a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">BattleForTheNet.com</a>,</b> which was responsible for more than &frac14; of all the net neutrality comments received by the FCC during its feedback process, and were behind the <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><b>Internet Slowdown</b></a> protest, which was supported by more than 40,000 websites including some of the largest on the Web like Kickstarter, Etsy, Netflix, and Tumblr.  </p><p>The group also helped take the fight for net neutrality into the streets with creative protest campaigns like <a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><b>Occupy the FCC</b></a> and the nationwide <b><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/11/7/headlines/internet_emergency_protests_across_us_condemn_latest_net_neutrality_plan" target="_blank">Internet Emergency</a> </b>protests. </p><p>Fight for the Future is continuing to work on defending net neutrality and the open Internet, as well as running campaigns against mass government surveillance, online censorship, and the secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which contains problematic copyright provisions that will negatively impact Internet users’ right to freedom of expression.</p><p>###</p>
