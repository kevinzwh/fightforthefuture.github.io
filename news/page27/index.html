It’s time we come together and let the sun go down on this dark age of government surveillance. Together we will end the PATRIOT Act, and the sun can rise on a new day filled with freedom and privacy for all.”</p><p>“Just a few weeks ago an expiration of 215 of any length seemed impossible, but hundreds of thousands have spoken out and upended conventional inside-the-Beltway wisdom”<b> said David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress. </b> “More than 13 years since the Patriot Act’s passage, and after craven abuse of Section 215 and other authorities, we are reminded why sunsets are written into bills like this: It is time for the intelligence agencies to answer for their violations of the public trust.”</p><p>“The PATRIOT Act, passed when the nation was in shock from the September 11 attacks, was never meant to be permanent. That&rsquo;s why sunset was written into the law,”<b> said Becky Bond, Vice President of CREDO Mobile. </b>“Our surveillance agencies have gone rogue, and sunsetting the PATRIOT Act – even if just for a few days – would be the first real step Congress has taken toward ending unconstitutional spying on Americans,” <b>Bond continued.</b><br/></p><p>““The NSA got caught with its hand in the cookie jar”,<b> said Alex Marthews, national chair of Restore The Fourth. </b>“The security agencies have been misusing the PATRIOT Act in order to spy on us all. Explain to me why we should let them keep doing it, instead of confining them to their real job: Spying on actual criminals and actual agents of foreign powers?”</p><p>“The balance between national security and civil liberties has been out of whack for more than a decade,&ldquo; s<b>aid Free Press Action Fund Government Relations Manager Sandra Fulton. </b>&quot;People have had enough of government efforts to spy on all aspects of our lives.

        <span class="date">Posted 13:26 EDT on May 21, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="1064"><img data-orig-height="1066" data-orig-width="1064" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nopm0k9gfL1s45cnp_540.png?1473544864423"/></figure><p>We’re so close to making the government get a legit warrant before they can monitor and track us. <b>For all the people who have ever wanted to see or worked towards the end of the Patriot Act over the past dozen years, this is our moment. </b><br/></p><p>If Congress does nothing—something they are very good at—the NSA’s mass phone data collection will <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/obama-admin-nsa-spying-will-begin-shutting-down-this-week-20150520" target="_blank">begin shutting down on Friday.</a> And on midnight of Monday, June 1, 2015, the section of the Patriot Act that has been used (illegally) to justify mass surveillance will sunset and no longer be U.S. law. </p><p>Holy shit. <br/></p><p><b><a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#protest" target="_blank">If you want the Patriot Act to die a quick and painless death (and even if you secretly want it to struggle and suffer, alone and afraid) Join us THIS EVENING at one of our 50+ nationwide Sunset the Patriot Act vigils. </a></b><br/></p><p>Here’s why we have such a golden opportunity right now.<br/></p><p>Because of Rand Paul’s filibuster of the Senate yesterday, things have been pushed back so that a vote on limiting debate on whether or not to begin debate of reauthorization of the Patriot Act (either straight up or under the Orwellian “<a href="http://usafreedom.fail/" target="_blank">USA Freedom Act</a>”) won’t happen until Saturday, after the NSA begins winding down its collection program. These motions on the reauthorization bills will require 60 votes to be approved, and that seems unlikely at this point. If they do somehow get 60 votes, a final vote won’t happen until Wednesday of next week. </p><p>But here’s the thing. All bills have to go through both the Senate and the House of Representatives before they can become law, and the House is leaving for vacation today until after the Patriot Act section expires. The House has already <a href="https://medium.com/@donnydonny/follow-the-money-usa-freedom-act-backers-in-congress-have-taken-more-than-twice-as-much-money-8e1f59d6be61" target="_blank">passed the USA Freedom Act</a>, which renews the Patriot Act, so the only real way for Congress to stop a sunset at this point is for the Senate to pass that bill. </p><p>Our <a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#congress" target="_blank">vote count</a> shows that the Senate doesn’t have the votes to pass it, so if we can prevent a few on-the-fence Senators from siding with the NSA on this, we will be going back to a world where law enforcement and Intelligence officials need to actually get a warrant to spy on us. </p><p>At that point, if Congress wants to bring back the ability for the government to spy on us without a warrant they will need to affirmatively re-legislate the PATRIOT Act. It won’t be just a matter of extending sunset dates anymore. Every member of Congress will have to go down on the record saying they don’t want the government to have to seek a warrant to spy on us, which is a very unpopular position and something that <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/09/64_percent_of_911_legislators.php" target="_blank">2/3rds</a> of the House of Representatives have never had to vote on. </p><p>We are so close to an epic win on mass surveillance. That’s why we’re hosting sunset vigils across the country this evening at senators’ local offices to call on the Patriot Act to expire. <br/></p><p>If you want this win; If you want the government to have to get a warrant before they can spy on you, your communications, and your family, Join us tonight. </p><p><b><a href="https://www.endsurveillance.com/#protest" target="_blank">Find a local Sunset the Patriot Act vigil here. </a></b></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-05-20-release-hundreds-of-tech-companies-to/">RELEASE: Hundreds of Tech Companies to Congress: TPP and Fast Track Harms Digital Innovation and Users’ Rights</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:43 EDT on May 20, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>May 20, 2015</p><p>Media Contact:<br/>Evan Greer<br/>Campaign Director, Fight For the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457, Email: <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>Maira Sutton<br/>Global Policy Analyst, Electronic Frontier Foundation<br/>Phone: (415) 436 - 9333 x175, Email:  maira@eff.org<br/><br/>In <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and" target="_blank">a joint letter</a> t</b>o Congress released today, more than 250 technology companies and user rights organizations say that the extreme level of secrecy surrounding trade negotiations have led to provisions in agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that threaten digital innovation, free speech, and access to knowledge online, and the letter calls on Congress to come out against the Fast Track (AKA Trade Promotion Authority [TPA]) bill for legitimizing this secretive process. Its signatories include AVG Technologies, DreamHost, Namecheap, Mediafire, Imgur, Internet Archive, BoingBoing, Piwik, Private Internet Access, and many others.<br/></p><p>The letter specifically identifies the TPP&rsquo;s threats based on leaked texts of the agreement—how it threatens fair use, could lead to more costly forms of online copyright enforcement, criminalize whistleblowing and investigative journalism, and create investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) courts that would further jeopardize user protections in domestic laws. The Fast Track bill, the companies write, would legitimize the exclusive process that has led to these and other provisions, as well as undermine lawmakers&rsquo; efforts towards striking the right balance between the interests of copyright holders and those of innovators and users.</p><p>“We simply cannot allow our policymakers to use secret trade negotiations to make digital policy for the 21st century,” <b>said Maira Sutton, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </b>“Leaks of the TPP agreement have revealed time and time again that this opaque process has led to provisions that undermine our rights to free speech, privacy, and innovation online. The TPP is a huge threat to the Internet and its users. Full stop.”</p><p>“The future of the Internet is simply too important to be decided behind closed doors,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future.</b> “The Fast Track / Trade Promotion Authority process actively silences the voices of Internet users, startups, and small tech companies while giving the biggest players even more power to set policy that benefits a few select companies while undermining the health of the entire Web.”</p><p><b>Harvey Anderson, Chief Legal Officer of the popular anti-virus software company AVG Technologies: </b>&ldquo;The current administration has done much to promote openness and transparency as governance principles and in managing Internet policy, they can, and we expect, that they can do much better than the current Fast Track bill.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Carl Wilcox, CEO of nanotech firm Advanced Surfaces and Processes, Inc.: </b>“Technology companies like us, especially startups and emerging companies, need a level business playing field, not one where mega corporations make the rules and can sue them in a mega-corporation court whose judges and attorneys are all employed by mega-corporations. TPP impacts us negatively when they dictate intellectual property, food safety, the price of prescription drugs, weak environmental, buy local and labor safety rules.”</p><p><b>David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at Basecamp and creator of the popular Ruby on Rails web development framework: </b> “TPP makes a mockery of democratic legislative ideals. It&rsquo;s shrouded in secrecy exactly because it would wither in sunlight. It&rsquo;s a terrible piece of overreach to endow a few special interests with enormous and unsavory power. The whole thing needs to be scrapped and started over. International trade is too important to have it hitched to this collection of wishful thinking by a select few.</p><p><b>Cory Doctorow, author, journalist, and co-editor of Boing Boing: </b>&ldquo;Democracies make their laws in public, not in smoke-filled rooms. If TPP&rsquo;s backers truly believed that they were doing the people&rsquo;s work, they&rsquo;d have invited the people into the room. The fact that they went to extreme, unprecedented measures to stop anyone from finding out what was going on—even going so far as to threaten Congress with jail if they spoke about it —tells you that this is something being done *to* Americans, not *for* Americans.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Founder of the Copia Institute, Mike Masnick: </b>“In the last two decades the Internet has been one of the main drivers of economic growth, progress and prosperity worldwide. And, yet, leaked portions of the TPP agreement and the current fast track bill shows that no one is even considering the impact on the digital economy and digital rights. The TPP and TPA are not designed for an Internet era, or even taking the Internet economy into account. That the whole thing has been written in secret only makes this more concerning over the impact it will have on the most dynamic and important sectors of the economy today.”</p><p><b>For the full letter, visit: <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/119439719948/hundreds-of-tech-companies-to-congress-tpp-and</a></b> </p><p>###</p>
