<p><strong>Net neutrality activists set up giant video billboard outside the FCC</strong></p>
<p><em>Domain registrar Namecheap and #InternetSlowdown organizers Fight for the Future have parked a truck with an 11&rsquo; video billboard directly across from the FCC building in Washington, DC. Title II supporters will play a steady stream of net neutrality videos sent from Internet users around the world. The billboard will remain through the FCC’s comment deadline tonight and during their Roundtable hearings on Tuesday.</em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON&ndash; Building off the momentum of last week’s </span><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><span><strong>record-breaking Internet Slowdown protest</strong></span></a><span>, net neutrality supporters have obtained a permit to park a truck with a roof-mounted 11’ wide video billboard directly outside FCC headquarters in Washington, DC. The billboard will be playing a stream of net neutrality related videos sent in from the Internet, including videos from today’s </span><strong><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/97229228063/whats-next-after-the-slowdown-rally-with" target="_blank">net neutrality rallies</a></strong><span> in NYC, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and webcam appeals from Internet users everywhere explaining why net neutrality matters to them.</span></p>
<p><span>Fight for the Future has posted an appeal for Internet users to submit videos to play on the billboard here: <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/97569336053/fight-for-the-future-and-namecheap-have-parked-a-truck" target="_blank">http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/97569336053/fight-for-the-future-and-namecheap-have-parked-a-truck</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Scroll to the bottom of this release for some initial photos. More photos will be available soon, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4v6p1nrfej6ybzp/AADRJ8mzOXNOZUlwyrJ1h7HKa?dl=0" target="_blank">some high-res photos available here.</a><br/></strong></p>
<p><span>The billboard action is supported by Fight for the Future, but is being coordinated by domain registrar Namecheap, who participated in the Internet Slowdown, and have released their own viral video to educate the Internet public about what’s at stake in the fight for net neutrality. Internet Slowdown organizers Free Press are also supporting the action, and are </span><strong><a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/sept_16_fcc_action/" target="_blank">coordinating a gathering</a></strong><span> outside the FCC on Sept 16th at 11:45am.</span></p>
<p><span>“Washington DC is worlds away from the vast majority of Internet users who would suffer from the FCC’s current proposal,” </span><strong>said Ted Worcester, Head of Product at Namecheap, who is camped out with a laptop running the video billboard across the street from the agency’s headquarters, </strong><span>“The video billboard helps give more people a way to get their message right in front of the FCC. Thanks to the open Internet, its easy for people to send us videos about why net neutrality matters to them.” </span></p>
<p><span>“The FCC is in a pretty lonely part of Washington DC,” </span><strong>said Holmes Wilson, co-founder of Fight for the Future,</strong><span> “Hopefully this video billboard will help brighten things up– with the voices of millions of people who are passionate about keeping the Internet free.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Advocacy groups have been calling for months for the FCC to get out of Washington DC to hear from the public before they make a decision that would allow for discrimination on the Internet,” </span><strong>said Evan Greer, Campaign Director of Fight for the Future, who helped coordinate the billboard effort,</strong><span> “If the FCC won’t go to the people, we’ll bring the people to the FCC, projected larger than life on a billboard that can’t be ignored. They need to get the message that we&rsquo;re not going away &ndash; it’s Title II or bust.”</span></p>
<p><strong>The action on the 16th is supported by <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>, <a href="http://www.freepress.net/" target="_blank">Free Press</a>, <a href="https://demandprogress.org/" target="_blank">Demand Progress</a>, and <a href="http://www.popularresistance.org/" target="_blank">Popular Resistance</a></strong><span><strong>.</strong> Fight for the Future, Free Press, and Demand Progress all contributed to organizing the </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">Battle for the Net</a></strong><span> </span><strong><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/" target="_blank">Internet Slowdown</a></strong><span>, in which over 40,000 websites (including huge sites like Reddit, Namecheap, Netflix, Etsy, Vimeo, Mozilla and many more) ran prominent warnings of an impending slowdown of Internet speeds if the FCC ends net neutrality. During the protest, Internet users made over </span><span>760,000</span><span> comments to the FCC and over </span><span>300,000</span><span> phone calls to Congress <strong>(See: </strong></span><strong><a href="http://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Infographic: the Internet Slowdown in Numbers and Screenshots</a>).</strong></p>

<p>This just in! We&rsquo;ve teamed up with our friends at domain registrar Namecheap to bring the overwhelming public outcry for real net neutrality protections directly to the agency&rsquo;s doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>As the hours count down to the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality comment deadline, we have obtained a permit to park a truck with a giant video billboard on top directly across the street from the FCC facing the agency&rsquo;s headquarters! It&rsquo;s amazing! We&rsquo;re attracting tons of attention already.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VobzCnTgrQt75LQwmkNGhFNlwvHDONpWxwWtNKB5wa0/viewform" target="_blank"><strong>Got something to say to the FCC? Send us a link to your video and we&rsquo;ll play it on the billboard!</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Are you in Washington, DC? </strong>Join us, Free Press, and Popular Resistance on Tuesday, September 16th as we gather near the billboard to call for the FCC to get out of DC and listen to the public! <a href="http://act.freepress.net/survey/sept_16_fcc_action/" target="_blank"><strong>More info here.  </strong></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be here until the end of the day Tuesday playing a steady stream of videos about net neutrality. The FCC needs to hear from everyone &ndash; but not everyone can make it to DC to speak out. <strong>The billboard gives us all a platform from which to speak, just like the free and open Internet!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internet, send us your videos! Take a short 1-2 minute video of yourself explaining why net neutrality matters to you, and we&rsquo;ll play it on the billboard for Tom Wheeler and everyone at the FCC. Use the form below to submit your video or email it directly to ted@namecheap.com with the subject line &ldquo;Billboard submission.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Namecheap gets that Internet Freedom isn&rsquo;t just a good idea, it&rsquo;s a critical fight for the future of the entire web. Not only are they making the billboard action possible, but they&rsquo;re helping raise funds for Fight for the Future to support our ongoing work for net neutrality. <strong><a href="http://netneutrality.com" target="_blank">Head over to NetNeutrality.com and share the video there and they&rsquo;ll donate to us each time!</a></strong></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-09-13-this-infographic-will-make-your-day-unless-you/">This infographic will make your day, unless you happen to be a Comcast lobbyist</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 15:06 EDT on September 13, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nbut27U0mN1r1kl7d.png?1473544867173"/></span></a></p>

<p><span>Hey!<br/><br/></span><span>Thanks to you, the Internet Slowdown was a resounding success. More people took action to defend net neutrality in one day than ever before in history. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">Click here to check out this inspiring infographic showing what we did together on September 10th. It will seriously make your day, unless you happen to be a Comcast lobbyist. </a></strong></p>
<p><span>Have a look. Like what you see? </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Please chip in $5 so we can keep the fight going.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The slowdown was so big it was impossible to ignore. Several members of Congress tweeted about how their phones were ringing off the hook, and we dominated the mainstream news headlines. More than 40,000 websites took part, including many of the most popular sites in the world, and at the peak of the day, there were more than 1,000 phone calls to congress </span><span>every minute!<br/><br/></span><span>This changes everything. Victory is more tangible now than ever before. But we still need to bring it home. <strong>Now that we’ve shown our strength, the giant Cable companies that are lobbying tooth and nail to destroy net neutrality will redouble their efforts</strong>, and work every connection they have to keep the public’s voice from being heard in Washington, DC.</span><span><br/><br/>There’s only one solution: we have to fight even harder, and grow our movement even larger, and we have to be ready to battle for the net for the long haul.</span></p>
<p><span>Organizing the Internet Slowdown day and hosting the website used up a huge amount of our resources. </span><strong>Will you chip in $5 (or more!) today to make sure we can keep the pressure on while we have so much momentum?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Yes, I will chip in today to save net neutrality!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>All of us here at Fight for the Future are so proud of the Internet right now. Now more than ever it&rsquo;s so clear how powerful the Internet really is as a platform for free speech, and how absolutely critical it is that we not only fight for it, but we fight to win.</span></p>
<p><span>With gratitude and determination,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Evan, Jeff, Kevin, Vasjen, and Jessica<br/>Fight for the Future</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. The deadline to submit comments to the FCC is this Monday, September 15th. We’re helping plan protests on that day in NYC and Philadelphia. There’s still time to submit a comment. If you haven’t yet, what are you waiting for?! Here’s the link: </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com</a></strong></p>
<p><span>P.P.S We really want everyone to see this infographic, it’s so epic! Check it out here: </span><strong><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/infographic</a></strong></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:48 EDT on September 12, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/infographic" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nbt3s21j8q1qb05d0.png?1473544867173"/></span></a></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6b97-e923-fafa-5c921440286b"><span>We have the latest numbers from the Internet Slowdown day of action, and a few awesome screenshots to verify them.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;re proud to announce that the Internet Slowdown generated an incredible response! The flood of comments coming through <strong><a href="http://Battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Battleforthenet.com</a></strong> was on the same order of magnitude as the total comments the FCC has received over the </span><span>entire </span><span>comment period. Suffice it to say the response quickly overwhelmed the FCC’s comment submission system early on Wednesday; the load was so large that they still don&rsquo;t have all the submissions in the docket yet. That’s why the FCC </span><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/khart/status/510112656460873728" target="_blank">does not have an official</a></strong><span> tally at the moment. </span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> A few news outlets have incorrectly reported much lower numbers, which were provided to reporters in error by the FCC. The number the FCC gave was just the number their failing website was able to process at the time. Since Tuesday, we had been working with the FCC to help make sure their servers stayed up. Early Wednesday, the FCC asked us directly to stop our submissions until the site came back online, or until they could find new ways to accept them (</span><strong><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/additional-option-filing-open-internet-comments" target="_blank">which they announced, late yesterday</a></strong><span>).</span></p>
<p><strong>The FCC communications team knew this at the time, but one of their spokespeople (we hope in error) provided the misleading 100,000 number to reporters. We asked the FCC several times to correct this error publicly in the form of a tweet. <strike>They have not done so yet.</strike></strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: The FCC has just published partial numbers totaling over 3 million, implying a jump of well over 1 million during the #InternetSlowdown. Thanks to the publication of this new total, journalists should be able to infer from this number that the 100,000 number was an error. <br/></strong></p>
<p>They <em>have</em> said that a final count is coming <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_2031221044"><span class="aQJ">on Tuesday</span></span>, that any number up until now hasn&rsquo;t been official, and that they may publish a preliminary count this weekend. We&rsquo;d welcome that. The sooner the 100,000 number gets corrected the better.</p>
<p><strong>The final number, when it arrives, will be huge.</strong></p>
<p><span>For now, the latest Internet Slowdown numbers are:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Number of websites participating using our tools</strong>: </span><span>40,806</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Calls made to Congress: our number + tumblr # + 30,000 from other companies</strong>:<span class="cwcot" id="cwos"><span class="cwcot"><span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6bb0-6595-1271-3f7fa91a1281"> 312,171</span></span></span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emails sent to Congress via battleforthenet.com</strong>:</span><span> 2,332,092</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Comments filed at the FCC via battleforthenet.com</strong>: </span><span>777,364</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Peak calls per minute to Congress from battleforthenet.com</strong></span><span>: </span><span>1,000</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Facebook shares of spinning icon</strong>: </span><span>more than 1,120,000</span></p>

<p><span>These numbers represent only the statistics that we can easily count and verify. Many websites directed people to call their representatives using other tools, or linked directly to emails for lawmakers and the FCC, so we know many more people took action on September 10th.</span></p>

<p><span>These numbers are higher than previous numbers we released on Wednesday, as more submissions have come in, and we’ve received more stats from participating websites. Also, our system for automatically counting the number of sites that had installed the widget was overwhelmed early during the protest, and when we looked into it we realized the number was much higher than we had originally reported (over 40,000 – not 10,000).</span></p>

<p><span>Check out our infographic for more of the story: </span><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank"><span><a href="https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic" target="_blank">https://battleforthenet.com/sept10th/#infographic</a></span></a></p>

<p><span>Read below for technical details regarding the numbers.</span></p>

<p><strong>40,806 sites participated using our tools:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Phone calls:</strong></p>

<p><span>The Internet Slowdown generated<span><strong><span class="cwcot"><span> 312,171</span></span></strong></span> phone calls to lawmakers. During peak hours, the rate of phone calls surpassed 1,000 calls per minute.</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s a screenshot from the back-end of the Twilio account used for calls from Battleforthenet.com, showing 143,074 calls completed:</span></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6bd1-09d8-0eec-f2eb8a9915d0">Here’s a screenshot from the Mobile Commons account Tumblr used for the calls they drove from their </span><a href="https://tumblr.com/stop" target="_blank"><span><a href="https://tumblr.com/stop" target="_blank">https://tumblr.com/stop</a></span></a><span> page showing 136,307 calls completed.</span></p>

<p><span>Additionally, Kickstarter, Etsy, and other sites helped drive more than <span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6baf-8feb-a1d2-72487e2b862b">32,790</span> calls from their own tools.</span></p>

<p><span>Adding these numbers together: 143,074 + 136,307 + <span id="docs-internal-guid-38327106-6bb0-1c35-6b69-b0218dfb21bc">32,790</span> = <strong><span> 312,171</span> calls</strong></span></p>

<p><span>Finally, here is a screenshot from 9/10/2014 Noon EST showing 1,000 phone calls per minute:</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Form submissions resulting in FCC comments and emails to Congress:</strong></p>

<p><span>777,364 people used Battleforthenet.com to submit a comment to the FCC on September 10th, and to trigger emails to their representatives. Each person sent 3 emails (one to each Senator and one to their rep in the House,) resulting in the total number of emails sent: 2,332,092</span></p>

<p><span>Here is a screenshot from the back-end of our Compose.io account showing the 777,364 submissions:</span></p>

<p><span>Other big numbers that have come in but were not included in our roundup include, OpenMedia.ca&rsquo;s reported 150,000 actions taken, and the many more comments that websites and national grassroots organizations submitted directly to the FCC.</span></p>

<p>Get ready to ditch your same-old lunch-hour routine on Sept. 15 and 16— because we need your help to fight FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s plan to allow discrimination online.</p>
<p>We are organizing protests in NYC, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington, DC to defend net neutrality. We need you there! Can you stop by?</p>
<p><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/nycprotest" target="_blank"><strong>Click here to get info and RSVP for the rally in NYC</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/phillyprotest" target="_blank">Click here to get info and RSVP for the rally in Philadelphia</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>BREAKING:</strong> Rally in <strong>Chicago.</strong> Sept 15th. <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_837264987"><span class="aQJ"></span></span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_837264988"><span class="aQJ">Noon-2 PM @ </span></span>Jackson &amp; LaSalle. Heart of the Chicago Financial District. Across the street from the Chicago Federal Reserve. <br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s the details:</p>
<p><strong>Sept. 15</strong> is the <strong><a href="http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_fcc_nprm_oliver/?source=FPblog" target="_blank">deadline for final comments</a> </strong>on Wheeler’s proposal — and while big broadband providers like Comcast are lobbying overtime to push this plan forward, we can’t let them have the last word. To that end we’ve organized big lunchtime rallies in <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/nycprotest" target="_blank"><strong>New York City</strong></a> and <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/phillyprotest" target="_blank"><strong>Philadelphia</strong></a> to save Net Neutrality and fight the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.</p>
<p><strong>On September 16th</strong>, internet freedom supporters will gather at 11:45am at the FCC building <a href="http://freepress.actionkit.com/mailings/view/4945" target="_blank"><strong>in Washington, DC,</strong></a> and our friends <strong><a href="https://www.netneutrality.com/" target="_blank">from Namecheap</a></strong> will be there with a giant video-billboard playing net neutrality videos on a loop! Want your video projected on the billboard? Email it to team@fightforthefuture.org &ndash; Check out Namecheap&rsquo;s awesome video here to get inspiration: <a href="http://NetNeutrality.com" target="_blank">http://NetNeutrality.com</a> </p>
<p>Your voice is essential right now. If you don’t live in DC, New York or Philly, you can organize a rally in your own community. It’s a pretty easy process and we’ve put together a <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/save-internet-event-guide" target="_blank">handy toolkit</a> </strong>with all the info you need to launch your own event.</p>
<p>All of us on #TeamInternet have made a ton of noise since Wheeler proposed his rules — sending <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/07/16/sorry-ms-jackson-net-neutrality-biggest-thing-ever-fcc" target="_blank">record-breaking numbers of comments</a></strong> to the FCC, rallying in <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/05/15/today-day" target="_blank">Washington, D.C.</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/07/24/net-neutrality-activists-take-over-california" target="_blank">California</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/08/29/net-neutrality-activists-take-senate-storm" target="_blank">meeting with our elected officials</a></strong> to push them to stand up for real Net Neutrality.</p>
<p>But we need to keep speaking out to win this one. We’ve got to keep the momentum moving until Wheeler faces facts and realizes that his proposal would kill the open Internet and please no one except mammoth companies like Comcast that want to squash their competition.</p>
<p>So grab your megaphone and get ready to rally on Sept. 15. Let’s make this national day of action one that Net Neutrality haters will never forget.</p>
