        <span class="date">Posted 18:35 EDT on July 30, 2014</span>


        <p><span>Hey there, </span></p>
<p><span>Got two seconds to help? </span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/disconnectvote" target="_blank">Please vote for Fight for the Future for Disconnect’s charity of the month!</a><br/><br/></strong><span>Exciting news! The Fight for the Future community is growing.</span><span> We now have more than 1 million members who are spread out all over the world</span><span>, and come from nearly every political viewpoint. Our love for the free and open Internet unites us.<br/><br/>While we’ve been growing our ranks, we’ve been keeping our team small and our costs low. There’s still just six of us running FFTF with the help of an amazing network of volunteers, coalition partners, and co-conspirators.</span></p>
<p><span>Many of you have funded our work. We&rsquo;ve been excited to report how we use our resources creatively &ndash; we go big or go home. </span><span>Just this year we:</span><span><br/></span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank"><span>occupied the FCC building for 10 days</span></a><span>, putting Title II net neutrality on the map and drawing international headlines, and then we launched Battleforthenet.com and broke the FCC’s website with a deluge of comments <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">just before the deadline.</a></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>organized </span><a href="http://resetthenet.org" target="_blank"><span>Reset the Net</span></a><span>, the <a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/was-epic-reset-net/" target="_blank">largest effort yet </a></span><span>to shut down mass surveillance with technology. The campaign was endorsed </span><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/87856695073/a-message-from-edward-snowden-on-the-eve-of-reset-the" target="_blank"><span>by Edward Snowden</span></a><span> and reached billions of people.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>began development on an open source app and browser extension (that many of you helped fund!) that will allow us to send urgent alerts without using email when the Internet is threatened. Want to help? <a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/TeamFutureForFirefox" target="_blank">Check out the code on github</a> and get involved.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li><span>brought together an <a href="http://stopfasttrack.com" target="_blank">unprecedented coalition</a> of tech companies, labor unions, environmental groups, leftists and libertarians to oppose Fast Track and the Trans Pacific Partnership’s secretive internet censorship plan.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>won the prestigious </span><a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/6/23/19-projects-win-knight-news-challenge-strengthening-internet/" target="_blank"><span>Knight Foundation&rsquo;s prototype award</span></a><span> to build a global anti-censorship alert system. Helped crowdfund thousands of VPNs to send to activists fighting censorship in Turkey.</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p><span>pushed back on the expansion of corporate meddling in Internet freedom by rallying </span><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank"><span>against CISA </span></a><span>(the new CISPA), collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures against Facebook’s </span><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/facebookopt-out/" target="_blank"><span>abusive practices</span></a><span>, and <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/89888291608/net-neutrality-protesters-arrested-late-last-night-at" target="_blank">supporting Occupy Google</a></span><span> when they were arrested for free speech.</span></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/disconnectvote" target="_blank">Click here to vote for Fight for the Future for Disconnect’s charity of the month!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>It doesn’t cost anything, so it’s an awesome way to help even if you’re broke! You don’t have to log in or share your email or anything. It takes two seconds and it could help us receive thousands of dollars of much needed funding that we’ll immediately use to continue ramping up the fight for net neutrality, online privacy, and free expression.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re so proud of what we’ve accomplished together! All 1,247,000 (and counting) of us.

        <span class="date">Posted 21:19 EDT on July 22, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n954zzhbcC1ri3xd7.png?1473544868162"/></span></a></p>
<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future members.</span></p>
<p><span>We had a huge showing for real net neutrality last week &ndash; more than 1 million people submitted comments to the FCC, and millions more spoke out through <strong><a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/tellfcc" target="_blank">petitions</a></strong>, phone <a href="http://dearfcc.org/call" target="_blank"><strong>calls</strong></a>, oh yeah, and by <strong><a href="http://occupythefcc.com" target="_blank">camping out</a></strong> on the FCC&rsquo;s doorstep.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><span>Our tiny team of staff and volunteers worked round the clock on <strong><a href="http://Battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">Battleforthenet.com</a></strong> in the days leading up to the comment deadline, and when the dust settled we had personally delivered 130,000 comments to the FCC in just 3 days. </span><span>That’s more than 1/3 of all the comments delivered during that time!</span></span></p>
<p><span>I’m so proud of all of you. Our little organization is giving these Big Cable bullies a run for their money! <br/></span></p>
<p><span>But with the kind of money they’ve got, we can’t afford to just keep fighting, we’ve got to take this to the next level and get the whole Internet organized for a crucial day of action this September before the FCC’s decision.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=net-neutrality" target="_blank">Please chip in today to help us win the battle for net neutrality.</a></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Last year, corporations that oppose net neutrality spent more than $1.4 million EVERY WEEK on lobbying. [1] That’s more than Fight for the Future’s entire yearly budget. </span><span>For two years!</span></span></p>
<p><span>We’ve been winning campaigns since SOPA on the same formula: we keep our team small and our costs low, we focus on strategy, and we’re not afraid to say what must be said and go all out when the time is right.</span></p>
<p><span><span>This Fall the FCC will either decide to protect the Internet or fundamentally break it. </span><span>We’re going to do everything in our power to make sure the people win. <strong>Will you help?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=net-neutrality" target="_blank">Please click here to donate what you can.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>The most exciting thing about this fight is that we’re not just trying to stop a bad bill like SOPA. If we succeed in getting the FCC to reclassify the Internet and enact real net neutrality, we’ll be protecting the Internet as a platform for the public good for generations to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all you’ve done. More soon.</span></p>
<p><span>-Tiffiniy, Evan, Holmes, and the whole FFTF team</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 16:20 EDT on July 18, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="http://www.netneutrality.com" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8xce8FJcq1ri3xd7.png?1473544868162"/></a></p>
<p>Namecheap, a leading domain registrar supporting more than 3 million websites, joined the fight for Title II reclassification in a big way today with the launch of <a href="http://netneutrality.com" target="_blank">http://netneutrality.com</a></p>
<p>The site will serve as a hub for Namecheap&rsquo;s net neutrality activism and it embeds Fight for the Future&rsquo;s FCC action form from <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank">http://battleforthenet.com</a></p>
<p>See their press release below and please spread the word!</p>
<p>###</p>
<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/></strong></p>
<p><span>Media contact: Namecheap<br/>Phone: +15089520110<br/></span>Email: ted@namecheap.com</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-0b499e91-4b21-9795-52c7-1f7523575a65"><strong>Leading domain registrar Namecheap strikes hard for open internet through reclassification with launch of NetNeutrality.com</strong></p>
<p><em>Company that supports more than three million domain names says lasting net neutrality is essential to the Internet economy, encourages customers to submit comments to FCC before midnight deadline</em></p>
<p><span>With 12 hours to go before the new deadline that closes the first round of comments in the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality proceeding, leading domain registrar Namecheap swooped in to strike hard on the side of an open Internet by launching </span><a href="http://netneutrality.com" target="_blank"><span>NetNeutrality.com</span></a><span>, an action site encouraging Internet users to continue bombarding the FCC with comments in support of Title II reclassification to protect the Internet in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC extended the original Wednesday comment deadline after various grassroots advocacy efforts like Fight for the Future’s BattleForTheNet.com action site flooded the FCC site with comments, causing it to go offline. As of Thursday July 17th, the FCC has received 1,030,000 comments, according to Gigi Sohn, Special Counsel for External Affairs for the FCC. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Over one million people depend on Namecheap to power their websites&rdquo; said Richard Kirkendall, Namecheap’s CEO and Founder, &ldquo;We have a moral responsibility to do everything we can as a company to defend the free and open Internet, ensuring that every single one of our customers can make their voice heard.”</span></p>
<p><span>“This is a crucial moment where we need every single voice raised demanding real net neutrality through Title II reclassification,” said Evan Greer, Campaign Manager at Fight for the Future. “Net neutrality is the free speech fight of our generation. It’s great to see so many voices, from huge sites to tiny blogs lining up to stand on Team Internet against any form of censorship online.”</span></p>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:39 EDT on July 17, 2014</span>


        <p><span><img alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_n8v7jhqrGX1ri3xd7.png?1473544868162"/></span></p>
<p><span>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>July 17th, 2014</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Media contact:</strong><br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future<br/>Phone: 978-852-6457<br/>Email: press@fightforthefuture.org<br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Activists Gear Up for Next Phase of Net Neutrality Fight With “Battle for the Net”</strong></p>
<p><em>BattlefortheNet.com site launches as first FCC comment phase winds down — more than 100k comments submitted in first 48 hours since launch; will serve as hub of organizing as the fight to save Net Neutrality continues.</em></p>
<p><span>Several leading grassroots organizations and web platforms today announced the launch of <a href="http://battleforthenet.com" target="_blank"><strong>BattlefortheNet.com</strong></a>, a site that will serve as a hub of organizing as the Net Neutrality fight proceeds.</span></p>
<p><span>Since it went live earlier this week, more than 100,000 Internet users have already used the website to urge the Federal Communications Commission to implement strong Net Neutrality regulations.  (The FCC’s website has been working inconsistently, so the comments remain in the process of being delivered.)  </span></p>
<p><span>Millions more Americans have made their support for Net Neutrality known to the FCC over the last six months, since a court struck down the FCC’s 2010 Open Internet Order — </span><span>representing the largest outpouring of concern about a proposed rule in the history of the FCC.</span></p>
<p><span>Net Neutrality is what makes the Internet a level playing field for all content providers and users.  Without Net Neutrality rules, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can choose to undermine certain sites by slowing their delivery speed to a crawl — while speeding up other sites, like those that pay the ISPs, or those that promote content that the ISPs own.  Start-ups, small business, artists, independent media outlets, and even more established sites would be undermined, as the ISPs seek greater private profit.</span></p>
<p><span>BattlefortheNet.com is framed as battle between “Team Cable” and “Team Internet”, with those who oppose Net Neutrality designated members of the former, and those who support it — included untold Internet users on the latter.  Over months to come, companies, politicians, public figures, and other important players in the fight will be encouraged to make their stand on the issue, and ever more activists will be encouraged to use the site to submit pro-Net Neutrality comments to the FCC.</span></p>
<p><span>(The first Net Neutrality comment phase ends tomorrow, after having been postponed from Tuesday because the outpouring of public caused the website to crash; a response phase will then run until September 10th.)</span></p>
<p><span>Early backers of the site include the groups Demand Progress, Fight for theFuture, Free Press and CREDO, and web platforms BoingBoing, reddit, Namecheap, Etsy, Kickstarter, StartPage, Tumblr, BitTorrent, Upworthy, and Cheezburger.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>According to Demand Progress executive director David Segal,</strong> “Millions of Americans have already spoken out in support of Net Neutrality — a level unprecedented in the history of the FCC.  With the launch of Battle for the Net, we’re taking this fight to an even higher level, as we’ve created a central space and a framework which will allow for the participation of millions more Americans, and demands that politicians and companies answer that most fundamental question: Whose side are you on?”</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;People depend on the Internet every day to communicate and meet their basic needs. That&rsquo;s why the FCC is seeing this record-breaking outcry,&rdquo; <strong>said Erik Martin, general manager of reddit,</strong> &ldquo;When you try to take away people&rsquo;s access to the open web, expect them to react similarly to if you tried to take away their access to water or electricity &ndash; the public won&rsquo;t stand for it, and the Internet gives them a voice to say so.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>“The FCC’s current proposal would break the Internet &ndash; so the Internet broke the FCC’s website with comments,” <strong>said Evan Greer of Fight for the Future,</strong> “Maybe before the Internet existed it would have been easy for mega-corporations like Comcast to screw us over without anyone noticing. But since the Internet is in fact a communication network, it has allowed the public’s voice to drown out lobbying dollars and PR firms. That&rsquo;s even more evidence that the Internet need to be reclassified as a public utility that serves public needs over corrupt and narrow private interests.”</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say who is more unpopular with the general public &ndash; cable companies or politicians,&rdquo; <strong>stated Becky Bond, political director of CREDO.</strong> &ldquo;But if you had to guess, politicians who side with the cable companies over the best interest of their constituents would be a pretty good bet. Elected officials who are tempted to sell out the very people they are supposed to represent should consider the serious blowback that is about to come their way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>“The Battle for the Net starts today at the FCC, but it will be carried to Congress, the White House and all across the country until we secure real NetNeutrality once and for all,” <strong>said Craig Aaron, president and CEO of Free Press.</strong> “Team Cable may have the most expensive lobbyists and more money to spend on its misinformation campaigns, but Team Internet will have thecreativity and commitment of millions of users behind it. Chairman Wheeler, President Obama and the rest of Washington should know that this is a fight in which you have to pick sides — but if you stand up for the Internet, the Internet will stand up for you.&ldquo;</span></p>
