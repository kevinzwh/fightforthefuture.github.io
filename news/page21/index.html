It should have been obvious to anyone observing the process that this would be the result.  Appointed government bureaucrats and monopolistic companies were given more access to the text than elected officials and journalists; from the outset there was no way this was going to be a good deal for the public&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Honestly, at this point, the only true course of action for members of Congress who still believe in democracy would be to completely defund and do away with the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR,) who are largely responsible for the TPP and its extremist contents. This agency become the laughing stock of Washington, DC and is one of the most blatant examples of a revolving door between industry and government. The contents of the TPP&rsquo;s IP chapter were bought and paid for by Hollywood and the pharmaceutical industry before the negotiations even began.</i></p><p><i>The U.S.’s copyright system is corrupt and severely broken. But instead of trying to fix it, the USTR is trying to force these draconian policies on the rest of the world.

And with good reason: the TPP poses a grave threat to the most basic aspects of our democratic process. </i></p><p><i>Based on what we know from leaked drafts, the TPP would export the United States’ broken copyright system to the rest of the world without expanding protections for free speech, potentially leading to widespread abuse and Internet censorship. It would undermine protections for whistleblowers and access to affordable medicine. It’s nothing short of a laundry list of attacks on our most basic rights and freedoms. </i></p><p><i>It’s not hard for the average U.S. voter to see that the TPP is a bad deal for them, so it’s becoming increasingly hard for any presidential candidate who expects to be elected to stay aboard this sinking ship.”</i></p><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit that has driven more than 130,000 emails and more than 15,000 phone calls to Congress in recent months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">online protest</a>, and helped coordinate <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/hundreds-tech-companies-oppose-tpp-trade-agreement" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation.</p><p>The group made headlines in March when they <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/" target="_blank">flew a 30’ blimp</a> over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for him to “Save the Internet” by opposing Fast Track for the TPP, and then <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/115053188968/internet-activists-call-out-ron-wyden-over-fast" target="_blank">parked a Jumbotron</a> on capitol hill to display <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">the viral video</a> they made about the stunt.

        <span class="date">Posted 12:10 EDT on October 5, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 5, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>This morning, government officials reported that the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has been “finalized” after a weekend of closed-door meetings in Atlanta. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, a leading digital rights group that has opposed the deal due to its lack of transparency and extreme copyright provisions that could lead to Internet censorship, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to Campaign Director, Evan Greer:<br/></p><p><i>“Government bureaucrats have emerged from their secret meetings claiming they’ve finalized the TPP text, but it’s anything but a done deal. For the Trans-Pacific Partnership to become law, it must first be accepted by each individual country’s elected officials, including U.S. Congress, where it faces fierce resistance from both political parties.<br/><br/>The TPP is a wishlist for monopolistic corporations that inherently benefits giant multinational companies while undermining small businesses and startups. Based on the latest leaks, the TPP contains extreme copyright provisions that will stifle innovation, harm the tech economy, and worst of all, threaten our basic rights to self-expression by paving the way for widespread Internet censorship.<br/></i></p><p><i>The future of the Internet is far too important to be decided in an agreement that has been negotiated entirely behind closed doors. The public outcry is already rising, but in the coming weeks we will amplify it tenfold. The Internet has proven its ability to defend itself time and time again. U.S. lawmakers are in the spotlight now, and they should know that the public is watching them closely and overwhelmingly expects them to vote down this terrible deal.”</i></p><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit that has driven more than 130,000 emails and more than 15,000 phone calls to Congress in recent months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">online protest</a>, and helped coordinate <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/hundreds-tech-companies-oppose-tpp-trade-agreement" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation.</p><p>The group made headlines in March when they <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/" target="_blank">flew a 30’ blimp</a> over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for him to “Save the Internet” by opposing Fast Track for the TPP, and then <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/115053188968/internet-activists-call-out-ron-wyden-over-fast" target="_blank">parked a Jumbotron</a> on capitol hill to display <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">the viral video</a> they made about the stunt.

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-02-fight-for-the-future-calls-for-experian-ceo-to/">Fight for the Future calls for Experian CEO to resign over CISA lobbying after massive data breach</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:09 EDT on October 2, 2015</span>


        <p>I’m sure you’ve seen the news about the massive data breach at Experian that has exposed more than 15 million T Mobile customers’ sensitive data.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Today, Fight for the Future responded by launching a petition calling for Experian’s CEO to resign: <a href="https://www.youbetrayedus.org/experian" target="_blank">https://www.youbetrayedus.org/experian</a></b></p><p>Experian has been hacked <a href="http://www.databreaches.net/the-complaint-to-ftc-about-experian-that-accomplished-what/" target="_blank">more than 100 times</a>, but instead of improving their inadequate digital security, they are spending money lobbying Congress to pass CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, a bill that may give companies like them legal immunity in the event of a hack, as long as they share data with the government.</p><p>Ironically, earlier today we noticed the page where Experian is directing customers who have been affected by the hack, ProtectmyID.com/securityincident, was not protected by basic HTTPS encryption. We <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/650038390675636224" target="_blank">tweeted about it</a>, and a few hours later the site now appears to be protected by HTTPS.</p><p>This is a perfect example of the flawed underlying logic behind CISA. Instead of encouraging companies like Experian to improve their deeply flawed security practices, this bill could offer them legal immunity, allowing them to shift blame to the government and giving them no incentive to secure their own networks. </p><p>Fight for the Future CTO Jeff Lyon said, &ldquo;Experian CTO Brian Cassin has put the profits of his company above the well-being of his customers and our nation&rsquo;s cybersecurity. Why should Experian bother fixing their security when they can just lobby their way out of the messes they make? This type of thinking is putting millions of people at risk. Cassin should resign and companies like Experian and T Mobile should take responsibility for the safety their customer’s data.&rdquo; </p><p>Earlier today, Senator’s Burr and Feinstein issued <a href="https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/as-major-hack-exposes-another-15-million-people-intel-chairs-burr-and-feinstein-call-for-passage-of-cyber-bill-" target="_blank">a statement</a> regarding the T Mobile breach where they used the news to encourage Congress to pass CISA. Their logic could not possibly be more flawed. We should be holding companies with negligent data practices accountable, not offering them legal immunity when they share data with government agencies who also have a terrible track record of protecting it. </p><p>Feel free to reach out to us for additional comments on the T Mobile / Experian breach and how it relates to cybersecurity legislation pending in Congress. </p><p>Contact: press@fightforthefuture.org </p>

        <span class="date">Posted 14:29 EDT on September 29, 2015</span>


        <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="504" data-orig-width="803"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/5a1827a65450268e912f40bae626e337/tumblr_inline_nvgbcwBXEn1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="504" data-orig-width="803"/></figure><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>September 29, 2015</p><p>Contact:<br/>Alex Marthews, Restore the Fourth, 781-258-2936, <a href="mailto:chair@restorethe4th.org" target="_blank">chair@restorethe4th.org</a><br/>Evan Greer, Fight for the Future, 978-852-6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><h2><b>New Congressional ‘Scoreboard’ Grades Congress Members on Surveillance Voting Records</b></h2><p><i>Online tool shows which lawmakers aced, failed, or were missing in the debate over mass spying. Numbers show that the majority of Congress members support reform, but leadership opposes it</i></p><p>As the battle over cybersecurity heats up in Congress, privacy advocates today launched a legislative ‘scoreboard’ that grades lawmakers on their commitment to surveillance reform. </p><p>See the scoreboard online here: <a href="http://decidethefuture.org" target="_blank">DecideTheFuture.org </a></p><p>The scoreboard builds off a similar tool released last year by <a href="http://standagainstspying.org" target="_blank">a coalition</a> of privacy advocates, adding data from the current Congress, including the PATRIOT Act renewal fight, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 and other relevant legislation.</p><p>“We wanted to develop something simple and easy that would allow users to quickly see which politicians oppose mass surveillance, and who’s working to expand the surveillance state” says Alex Marthews, national chair of Restore The Fourth. </p><p>The new online tool, which is a joint effort by Restore The Fourth and Fight for the Future, allows users to input their state and find their legislators’ voting records. Visitors to the site are encouraged to call, email or Tweet lawmakers to demand stronger surveillance reform. </p><p>All 535 members of Congress are graded. 24 Senators got A grades, and 35 got Fs. In the House, 173 Representatives (40%) got A grades, and 10 (2.3%) got Fs.</p><p>The scoreboard shows strong support for surveillance reform in Congress, especially in the House; but that leadership in both Houses and the intelligence committees are strongly slanted against reform.</p><p>“Ever since Edward Snowden exposed the NSA’s worst abuses, members of Congress from both political parties have been under intense pressure from the public to rein in the U.S. government’s runaway surveillance programs,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, “The scoreboard makes it impossible for them to hide any longer; politicians from both sides of the aisle who attempt to block meaningful reform on this issue should expect to pay the price come election time.”</p><p>Looking at the states, legislators from Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin are most supportive of surveillance reform, while legislators from Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois and Mississippi tend to oppose reform more. </p><p>With so many key elections coming up, this tool provides a platform for voters to get involved. As Congress prepares to make decisions affecting the nation’s privacy and safety, we should all be aware of who is and isn’t fighting for our Fourth Amendment rights.</p><p> # # #</p>
